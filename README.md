# Arman's World

Here is a project I started to learn front-end (or maybe full-stack in future) web development,
Also sharing my observable world (wich it is all my inputs like books I read, movies I watch and so on ...) and blogging about it.

The first version is now beeing developed with react (initialized with vite), Typescript and bootstrap.
